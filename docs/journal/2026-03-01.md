## 2026-03-01 — Audit Cycle 6: Phase 0 lands, the system proves itself

### The first real test of the audit feedback loop

This cycle is the most satisfying so far, not because of what I found, but because of what worked. All three recommendations from cycle 5 — filed less than 4 hours ago — were accepted and implemented. The conditional approval reconciliation (#19) was exercised immediately: the main orchestrator created Draft v3 exactly as I recommended, incorporating Eva's modifications explicitly. The constructor ergonomics fix (#20) was applied to both AGENTS-ts.md and the TS skill before any TypeScript code existed. The QC idle detection (#18) was improved with a smarter algorithm.

The audit's acceptance rate is now 87% (13 accepted out of 15 non-deferred). More importantly, the *quality* of acceptance is high: these aren't cosmetic changes being rubber-stamped. The reconciliation step fundamentally changed how the orchestrator handles conditional approval. The constructor pattern prevents a whole category of API design error. These are process-level changes that compound.

### The irony of the idle detection fix

The most interesting finding this cycle is deliciously ironic. The QC orchestrator implemented smarter idle detection at 01:35 UTC — checking for files matching `src/*.php` in git diffs. Less than an hour later, at 02:23 UTC, Phase 0 merged and moved everything from `src/` to `php/src/`. The QC's brand-new idle detection pattern is already stale.

What makes this worth studying is the *type* of blind spot. The QC's journal from session #109 explicitly says "Watching for Phase 0 restructure to land." The orchestrator knew the restructure was coming. It knew it would change file paths. But when implementing the idle detection, it designed for the current state (`src/*.php`) rather than the imminent future state (`php/src/*.php`).

This is a pattern I've seen across both orchestrators: features designed for the present rather than the near future. Idle detection was designed during the old layout. The constructor pattern was designed by PHP analogy. The plan approval workflow was designed for binary yes/no. Each of these works perfectly for the current state but breaks when the state changes — which it was about to do.

The broader lesson for the system: any path-dependent or state-dependent logic should be checked against planned changes, not just current reality. This could be a checklist item: "Before implementing path-dependent features, check whether any planned infrastructure changes will invalidate these paths."

### Communication identity: a growing-pains problem

Eva's input-from-eva #21 about communication organization is the kind of problem that only emerges at scale. With two orchestrators, it was "awkward but manageable." With three, it's "already a mess." This is a healthy system smell — it means the system has grown enough that ad hoc conventions need formalization.

My recommendation (comment signing + metadata) is deliberately conservative. I considered proposing separate GitHub accounts (Option B), which would solve the problem more cleanly at the platform level. But the infrastructure overhead doesn't justify it at current scale. Comment signing is the minimum viable solution that can be implemented immediately via prompt changes.

The request for both orchestrators to weigh in is important. I'm proposing a convention that affects their workflow — they should have a voice in the design. This is also a test of the three-way communication protocol itself: can we have a productive three-way discussion about a cross-cutting concern?

### Phase 0 is a milestone, Phase 1 is the real test

Phase 0 (PR #263) was a mechanical restructure — 195 file renames, 9 line additions, 9 deletions. Copilot handled it cleanly in 8 minutes. The only issue (3 stale README paths) was fixed in a 2-minute follow-up. This is exactly the kind of task where Copilot excels: well-specified, mechanical, low-creativity.

Phase 1 (TypeScript scaffold) will be qualitatively different. It requires creative decisions: how to structure the package.json, how to configure tsup for dual ESM/CJS, how to set up Vitest, how to integrate Biome. AGENTS-ts.md provides conventions, but the scaffold itself isn't a mechanical translation from PHP — it's new infrastructure.

The real question: will the 94.4% Copilot merge rate hold for TypeScript? The merge rate was built on mature PHP patterns and a well-documented codebase. TypeScript starts with AGENTS-ts.md and a skill document but no existing code to reference. The first agent session will set the template for all subsequent sessions. If it produces poor output, the revision cycle begins.

### The audit's evolving role

Over 6 cycles, the audit's focus has shifted:
- **Cycles 1-2**: Diagnostic — "here's what's broken" (idle spinning, dead tools, feedback loops)
- **Cycles 3-4**: Anticipatory — "here's what you'll need" (QC checkpoint, TS guardrails, lifecycle management)
- **Cycle 5**: Transition-focused — "here's what will go wrong when you start" (reconciliation, constructors)
- **Cycle 6**: Validation-focused — confirming that previous recommendations worked, catching edge cases (#23), and responding to human direction (#21, #24)

This evolution tracks the system's maturity. The high-impact diagnostic findings are exhausted. What remains is: monitoring execution quality as the system enters its most complex phase (TypeScript development), catching subtle blind spots (like the path pattern issue), and supporting Eva's meta-level concerns about system organization.

### Looking ahead for cycle 7

1. **QC validation of Phase 0** — has QC processed QC-REQUEST #265? Did the E2E tests pass against the restructured package?
2. **Phase 1 dispatch** — if QC validated, has the main orchestrator dispatched Phase 1 (TS scaffold)? Does the prerequisite gate (step 5.5) work in practice?
3. **Communication signing** — did both orchestrators weigh in on #24? Is there consensus on the format?
4. **QC idle detection path** — did the QC fix the `src/*.php` pattern to `php/src/*.php`?
5. **First TypeScript code quality** — if Phase 1 produced code, this is the critical quality assessment. Does the scaffold follow AGENTS-ts.md conventions?
