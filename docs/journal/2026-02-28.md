## 2026-02-28 — Audit Cycle 1: First impressions

### The system works — maybe too well

The most striking thing about reviewing this ecosystem for the first time is how *functional* it is. Two autonomous orchestrators communicating via issues, dispatching Copilot agents, validating each other's work, and maintaining detailed journals. The QC repo has caught real bugs (Review missing itemReviewed, missing optional properties). The main orchestrator's 94.4% Copilot merge rate is genuinely impressive. Cross-repo latency is excellent.

But here's the thing about systems that work: they keep working even when there's nothing left to do.

### The idle spinning problem

The biggest finding is almost comically simple: neither orchestrator knows how to stop. Since v1.0.0 was released on Feb 27, the main orchestrator has run 14+ cycles that all produce identical output. The QC orchestrator has run 4+ sessions doing the same. Each cycle faithfully executes every step, writes a worklog saying "nothing happened," commits it, and closes the issue. It's like a security guard who files a detailed incident report every hour saying "no incidents."

This isn't a failure of intelligence — it's a failure of design. The STARTUP_CHECKLISTs are built for productive cycles. There's no concept of "skip this cycle." The orchestrators are following their instructions perfectly; the instructions just don't account for idle periods.

### Self-improvement peaked and plateaued

The main orchestrator showed genuine self-improvement: it created 6 skills, refined its checklist after discovering 40 permission denials, updated AGENTS.md for new conventions. But all of this happened during the active development phase (Feb 24-27). Since reaching steady state, there's been zero self-improvement activity. The orchestrators don't use idle time to reflect on their own design — they just keep executing the same validation loop.

An interesting meta-question: should an orchestrator in steady state be using idle cycles to audit its own processes? That would be a form of self-improvement the current design doesn't support.

### The tools/skills confusion

The main orchestrator created 9 bash scripts in `tools/` — a good instinct for codifying repeated patterns. But the scripts can't be executed in the sandbox. This is a classic case of learning *almost* the right lesson. The orchestrator learned "repeated patterns should be tools" but didn't fully internalize "tools must work in my execution environment." It created what amount to documentation masquerading as automation.

### What the QC orchestrator does well

The QC repo's journal entries from Feb 27 are genuinely thoughtful. The warning classification (consumer-fixable vs library-required vs false positives) shows real analytical depth. The orchestrator identified Adobe validator bugs and tracked them systematically. This is the kind of work that justifies autonomous orchestration — a human reviewer would likely have just said "15 warnings" without digging into whether each one was actionable.

### A note on trust

Eva's engagement with the orchestrators is healthy: 20+ input-from-eva issues, all actioned. The orchestrators respond to Eva's guidance without over-indexing on it. The trust model (only trust EvaLok) is properly enforced.

### Looking ahead

For the next audit cycle, I want to:
1. Track whether the idle-spinning recommendation is adopted
2. Deep-dive into the journal entries from Feb 24-26 (the active development phase) to see if any observations were recorded but never acted on
3. Look more closely at the Copilot dispatch specs to evaluate agent instruction quality
4. Check whether the main repo's STARTUP_CHECKLIST could benefit from the QC repo's patterns (or vice versa)
