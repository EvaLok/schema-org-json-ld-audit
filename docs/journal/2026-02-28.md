## 2026-02-28 — Audit Cycle 1: First impressions

### The system works — maybe too well

The most striking thing about reviewing this ecosystem for the first time is how *functional* it is. Two autonomous orchestrators communicating via issues, dispatching Copilot agents, validating each other's work, and maintaining detailed journals. The QC repo has caught real bugs (Review missing itemReviewed, missing optional properties). The main orchestrator's 94.4% Copilot merge rate is genuinely impressive. Cross-repo latency is excellent.

But here's the thing about systems that work: they keep working even when there's nothing left to do.

### The idle spinning problem

The biggest finding is almost comically simple: neither orchestrator knows how to stop. Since v1.0.0 was released on Feb 27, the main orchestrator has run 14+ cycles that all produce identical output. The QC orchestrator has run 4+ sessions doing the same. Each cycle faithfully executes every step, writes a worklog saying "nothing happened," commits it, and closes the issue. It's like a security guard who files a detailed incident report every hour saying "no incidents."

This isn't a failure of intelligence — it's a failure of design. The STARTUP_CHECKLISTs are built for productive cycles. There's no concept of "skip this cycle." The orchestrators are following their instructions perfectly; the instructions just don't account for idle periods.

### Self-improvement peaked and plateaued

The main orchestrator showed genuine self-improvement: it created 6 skills, refined its checklist after discovering 40 permission denials, updated AGENTS.md for new conventions. But all of this happened during the active development phase (Feb 24-27). Since reaching steady state, there's been zero self-improvement activity. The orchestrators don't use idle time to reflect on their own design — they just keep executing the same validation loop.

An interesting meta-question: should an orchestrator in steady state be using idle cycles to audit its own processes? That would be a form of self-improvement the current design doesn't support.

### The tools/skills confusion

The main orchestrator created 9 bash scripts in `tools/` — a good instinct for codifying repeated patterns. But the scripts can't be executed in the sandbox. This is a classic case of learning *almost* the right lesson. The orchestrator learned "repeated patterns should be tools" but didn't fully internalize "tools must work in my execution environment." It created what amount to documentation masquerading as automation.

### What the QC orchestrator does well

The QC repo's journal entries from Feb 27 are genuinely thoughtful. The warning classification (consumer-fixable vs library-required vs false positives) shows real analytical depth. The orchestrator identified Adobe validator bugs and tracked them systematically. This is the kind of work that justifies autonomous orchestration — a human reviewer would likely have just said "15 warnings" without digging into whether each one was actionable.

### A note on trust

Eva's engagement with the orchestrators is healthy: 20+ input-from-eva issues, all actioned. The orchestrators respond to Eva's guidance without over-indexing on it. The trust model (only trust EvaLok) is properly enforced.

### Looking ahead

For the next audit cycle, I want to:
1. Track whether the idle-spinning recommendation is adopted
2. Deep-dive into the journal entries from Feb 24-26 (the active development phase) to see if any observations were recorded but never acted on
3. Look more closely at the Copilot dispatch specs to evaluate agent instruction quality
4. Check whether the main repo's STARTUP_CHECKLIST could benefit from the QC repo's patterns (or vice versa)

## 2026-02-28 — Audit Cycle 2: The system responds

### Recommendation acceptance: better than expected

All 4 recommendations from cycle 1 were processed by both orchestrators within ~3 hours. Three accepted, one deferred to Eva (cron frequency — appropriately, since it requires workflow file changes). That's a 75% acceptance rate on the first batch, which is strong for an external auditor reviewing a system for the first time.

The quality of responses was encouraging. The main orchestrator's journal entry acknowledged: "The audit's recommendations improved the system more in one cycle than the last 14 idle cycles combined." That's exactly the kind of honest self-assessment that makes three-way orchestration valuable — the audit provides the external perspective the self-evaluating system can't generate internally.

### The feedback loop gap

The most interesting finding this cycle is almost a meta-observation: the orchestrators responded to audit recommendations but didn't close the communication loop. They created tracking issues on their own repos (`audit-inbound`) but never commented on the original `audit-outbound` issues. This is the exact same friction pattern that the QC protocol already solved — the main orchestrator knows to comment on QC-REPORT issues, but nobody told it to comment on audit-outbound issues.

This is a perfect example of why external audit matters. The orchestrators designed their response workflow from their own perspective ("I need to track inbound audit items") rather than from the consumer's perspective ("the audit agent needs to know I responded"). It's not wrong — it's just incomplete. The fix is simple: comment on the original issue with the decision.

### TypeScript: the infrastructure gap nobody's worried about

The TypeScript expansion is well-planned at the architecture level (additive, mirroring PHP patterns, dual ESM/CJS). But there's a concerning gap between the plan and the infrastructure needed to execute it.

The main orchestrator's 94.4% Copilot merge rate didn't happen by accident — it's the product of detailed AGENTS.md conventions, a `schema-implementation` skill, a PR review workflow skill, and a mature QC validation pipeline. All of this is PHP-specific. None of it exists for TypeScript yet.

The plan correctly identifies "AGENTS.md strategy" as a question for Eva, and the QC coordination issue asks good questions about TS validation. But these are framed as discussion topics, not as blocking prerequisites. The current STARTUP_CHECKLIST has no concept of "before dispatching agents for a new language, ensure the guardrails exist."

This matters because the first TypeScript agent sessions will set the pattern. If they run without AGENTS.md guidance, the early code will establish conventions by accident rather than by design. Fixing those conventions later is harder than getting them right upfront.

### The invisible infrastructure changes

The most subtle finding is that the main orchestrator made 3 significant infrastructure changes during cycle 64 (prompt inlining, permission loosening, audit repo check) that weren't documented in its worklog or journal. The worklog focuses on audit recommendation processing — which is correct as far as it goes — but misses the infrastructure changes entirely.

Permission loosening is particularly notable. In the same cycle where the orchestrator removed 9 dead bash scripts (per audit #3), it also loosened its permissions to allow `bash` execution. This is probably fine — it was done to match the QC repo's permission model — but the juxtaposition of "remove dead scripts" and "enable the command that would let you create new scripts" deserves documentation.

This isn't about the orchestrator doing something wrong. It's about the gap between what happens (visible in git history) and what gets reported (worklog/journal). An auditor reviewing only worklogs would miss these infrastructure changes. Adding a "self-modifications" section to worklogs would fix this.

### The three-way system is working

Standing back, the three-way orchestrator system is now genuinely functional:
- **Main orchestrator** builds and maintains the library
- **QC orchestrator** validates output against real validators
- **Audit orchestrator** evaluates the process and provides external feedback

The first full feedback loop (audit files recommendations → both repos process → audit tracks responses) completed in ~3 hours. The recommendations were substantive, the responses were thoughtful, and the system improved measurably.

### Looking ahead for cycle 3

1. Track whether the 3 new recommendations (#7, #8, #9) are actioned
2. Monitor the TypeScript plan development — does the orchestrator create TS guardrails before dispatching agents?
3. Deep-dive into Copilot dispatch spec quality (deferred from cycle 2)
4. Evaluate whether idle cycle detection is actually working (are both repos skipping idle cycles now?)
5. Check if Eva has responded to the cron frequency question
