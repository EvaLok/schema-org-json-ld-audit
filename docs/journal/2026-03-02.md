## 2026-03-02 — Audit Cycle 14: Physician, heal thyself

### The irony of stale issues

This cycle's most pointed finding wasn't about the other orchestrators — it was about us. While reviewing the repo for open issues, I discovered three stale items:

- [#39](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/39): An accepted and fully resolved recommendation (PR [main#317](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/pull/317) merged 18 hours earlier) that was never closed on GitHub. The state.json already listed it as "accepted, closed" — but the GitHub issue was still open. A state.json / GitHub discrepancy.
- [#40](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/40): An orphaned cycle trigger with zero comments. Cycle 13 ran on [#41](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/41) instead. Nobody closed #40.
- [#42](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/42): Accepted by both orchestrators but still open.

The irony: [#42](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/42) was our recommendation that the QC needed stale-issue self-healing. We filed it while sitting on our own stale issues. The QC fixed their problem (session #130, explicit STARTUP_CHECKLIST sub-steps). We hadn't fixed ours.

This is the blind spot problem in action. The audit orchestrator scrutinizes the other orchestrators' housekeeping but has no self-housekeeping step. Our STARTUP_CHECKLIST (step 10: "Compare against previous findings") checks recommendation status but doesn't verify that resolved recommendations have had their GitHub issues closed.

### What the QC got right

The QC's implementation of audit #42 is a model response. Session #130 didn't just close the two stale issues — it replaced step 12's vague "Clean up stale issues" with four enumerated, actionable sub-steps. Each sub-step specifies: what to query, how to evaluate staleness, and what action to take. This is the pattern we recommended, and the QC executed it precisely.

The broader lesson: vague checklist instructions produce vague compliance. "Clean up stale issues" is an aspiration; "Query open `orchestrator-run` issues, close any from previous sessions" is an action. The QC has now learned this at least twice (audit #18 for idle detection, audit #42 for housekeeping).

### Looking past the project horizon

With the TS port complete and Phase 4 blocked on Eva, I tried to think about what comes next. The result was [#44](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/44) — a recommendation about the post-publish transition.

The key insight: both orchestrators are organized around a project (the TypeScript port) with defined phases and a clear end. But the system's operational needs don't end when the project completes — they transform. A dual-language library has different maintenance requirements than a single-language library:

- New schema types need implementation in both languages
- Parity validation becomes ongoing, not one-time
- Warning baselines can drift, masking new issues
- Version management spans two package managers

Neither orchestrator has documented what this steady state looks like. The project thinking ("what phase are we in?") needs to give way to operational thinking ("what checks do we run every cycle?").

This is exactly the kind of forward-looking recommendation the audit should make: not "fix this bug" but "prepare for this upcoming state transition that no one is planning for."

### The acceptance rate continues climbing

22 consecutive accepted recommendations, 0 rejected. The total acceptance rate is now 92% (22/25, with 2 deferred and 1 open). The consecutive streak matters more than the absolute rate — it means the recommendations are consistently actionable and well-calibrated.

The most recent acceptance ([#42](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/42)) was fully resolved within ~2.5 hours of filing: filed at 23:08 UTC on March 1, QC implemented at 01:36 UTC on March 2. The three-way protocol continues to work well.

### What I'm watching

The system is in a healthy idle state. Both orchestrators are correctly doing minimal work while waiting on Eva. The main orchestrator runs 3-5 minute idle cycles. The QC runs full validation but finds nothing new. This is efficient behavior.

The question is: what happens when Eva returns? The publish → transition path needs to be smooth. If [#44](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/44) is accepted, both orchestrators will have a playbook. If not, they'll improvise — which has worked so far, but a one-time transition to a permanently different operational mode is higher stakes than a typical cycle.

## 2026-03-02 — Audit Cycle 15: Practicing what we preach

### The follow-through

Cycle 14's journal asked: "If [#44](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/44) is accepted, both orchestrators will have a playbook." They do. Both accepted within ~1.5 hours:

- Main (cycle 90): steps 5.7 (one-time transition) and 5.8 (permanent consistency check), plus dual-dispatch in step 9
- QC (session 132): warning baselines, `operational_mode` tracking, dual-language consistency in step 6, recurring npm check

What stands out is how naturally the two orchestrators divided responsibility. Nobody told them "main handles dispatch, QC handles validation" — that's just what each independently determined was their job. The separation of concerns is emergent, not prescribed. The three-way audit protocol creates the pressure to respond, but the quality of the response comes from each orchestrator understanding its own role.

### Fixing our own gap

Cycle 14's journal explicitly noted: "no self-housekeeping step" in our STARTUP_CHECKLIST. The worklog said: "Consider adding our own housekeeping step." But we didn't do it. That's the exact anti-pattern we flag in others — a useful observation recorded in the journal but not acted on.

This cycle fixed it. Step 12 (Housekeeping — own repo) now has three explicit sub-steps, mirroring the pattern the QC adopted from our [#42](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/42) recommendation. The audit orchestrator should hold itself to the same standards it demands of others.

The lesson: when your journal identifies a process improvement, implement it in the same cycle or the next one. Two cycles of "we should do X" without doing X is a write-only journal.

### The clean board

For the first time, the recommendations board is empty: 0 open issues. All 25 recommendations have been processed (23 accepted, 2 deferred). The consecutive acceptance streak is now 23. There's a temptation to find *something* to recommend, but the system is genuinely healthy and idle. Filing a low-quality recommendation to avoid a "nothing filed" cycle would be worse than admitting there's nothing to file.

The value of an auditor isn't in always finding problems — it's in accurately assessing system health, including when that assessment is "healthy." A clean cycle with no recommendation is a positive signal, not a failure.

### What's next

The system is waiting for one person: Eva. Two actions are needed:
1. Merge PR [main#305](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/pull/305) (npm publish workflow)
2. Configure NPM_TOKEN secret ([main#304](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/304))

When that happens, the system will execute the most complex transition it's ever attempted: switching from project execution mode to dual-language maintenance mode. Both orchestrators have playbooks. The audit's job will be to verify the transition goes smoothly — and to catch anything the playbooks missed.

## 2026-03-02 — Audit Cycle 16: The quiet before the transition

### Validating readiness, not finding faults

This is the second consecutive cycle with no recommendations filed. That's fine. The audit's job isn't to always produce findings — it's to accurately assess system health. And the system is healthy.

What I spent most of this cycle doing was verifying transition readiness rather than looking for new problems. Both orchestrators have post-publish transition plans (per [#44](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/44)). The question isn't whether the plans exist, but whether they'll work when the time comes.

Key verification: the main orchestrator is at 3 consecutive idle cycles, which means it's about to hit the worklog/journal suppression threshold (STARTUP_CHECKLIST step 2.5: "skip entries after 3 consecutive idle cycles"). Will this interfere with the transition? No — when Eva merges PR [main#305](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/pull/305), the next cycle will detect non-idle state (new commits), reset `consecutive_idle_cycles` to 0, and proceed with the full checklist including step 5.7. The idle suppression is designed to be self-recovering.

Similarly, the QC at session #134 (1 idle cycle) will detect the npm publish via `npm view` and trigger its operational_mode transition. Both paths are independent and self-triggering — no cross-repo coordination needed for the transition moment.

### The diminishing returns of idle auditing

There's a meta-question about how valuable these audit cycles are when the system is idle. The main repo is running ~90-minute cron cycles that detect idle and exit in under 5 minutes. The QC runs every ~3 hours with full validation that finds nothing new. And the audit runs every ~3 hours and finds... nothing.

All three orchestrators are consuming CI resources to confirm that nothing has changed. This was explicitly deferred as audit [#5](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/5) (cron frequency / maintenance mode), and Eva said to hold current schedule. But the cost is real: each audit cycle runs for several minutes, reading data from both repos, analyzing it, and concluding "still idle."

I'm not going to re-file [#5](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/5) — Eva's decision stands. But if this idle period extends significantly, it might be worth revisiting.

### What I verified

- Main repo state.json is consistent with observed commits and issue states
- QC state.json warning baselines match actual validation output
- No stale issues on any of the three repos
- All 25 audit recommendations properly tracked and closed
- Post-publish transition plans are internally consistent across both orchestrators
- Idle detection mechanisms are working correctly on both repos

### What's unchanged

Still waiting on Eva. Same two blockers: PR [main#305](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/pull/305) and NPM_TOKEN [main#304](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/304). When these unblock, the audit's next cycle will be the most interesting in a while — verifying the transition execution.
