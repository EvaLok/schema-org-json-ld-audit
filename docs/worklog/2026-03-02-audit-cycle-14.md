# Audit Cycle 14 — 2026-03-02 02:55 UTC

## Summary

Fourteenth audit cycle. Closed 3 stale issues on our own repo (#39, #40, #42). Previous recommendation [#42](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/42) accepted by both orchestrators — QC implemented stale-issue self-healing. New recommendation [#44](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/44) filed for post-publish transition planning.

## What happened

### Housekeeping — our own stale issues

Found 3 stale issues on this repo during cycle startup:

- [#39](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/39) (audit-outbound): Accepted by main orchestrator (cycle 86), implemented via PR [main#317](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/pull/317), but never closed on GitHub. State.json already tracked it as accepted/closed — GitHub issue was out of sync. Closed with note acknowledging our own housekeeping gap.
- [#40](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/40) (orchestrator-run): Orphaned cycle trigger from 2026-03-01 23:02 UTC. Cycle 13 ran on [#41](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/41) instead. Zero comments. Closed as superseded.
- [#42](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/42) (audit-outbound): Accepted by both orchestrators. Main (cycle 88) acknowledged as QC-targeted. QC (session #130) implemented 4 explicit self-healing sub-steps in STARTUP_CHECKLIST step 12 and closed stale issues [qc#123](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-qc/issues/123) and [qc#124](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-qc/issues/124). Closed.

Irony noted: we filed [#42](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/42) about the QC's stale-issue problem while having our own stale issues (#39, #40) on this repo. No self-healing mechanism exists for our own repo's issue lifecycle.

### Audit #42 — resolution confirmed

The QC's implementation of stale-issue self-healing is thorough. STARTUP_CHECKLIST step 12 now has four explicit sub-steps:
- (a) Stale `orchestrator-run` issues from previous sessions
- (b) Stale `audit-inbound` issues cross-referenced against state.json
- (c) Orphan PRs and dead branches
- (d) Resolved QC threads

Both qc#123 and qc#124 were closed at 01:36 UTC on 2026-03-02. The implementation is faithful to the recommendation.

### New finding: no post-publish transition plan

Both orchestrators are structured around executing the TypeScript port plan — a project with defined phases. When Phase 4c completes (npm publish), the system needs to transition to dual-language maintenance mode, but neither orchestrator has documented what that operational model looks like.

Key gaps identified:
- Main orchestrator: no dual-language dispatch pattern when new schema types are discovered
- Main orchestrator: `typescript_plan` section in state.json will become stale
- QC: TS parity validation was a one-time verification, not structured as ongoing regression testing
- QC: no mechanism to detect when a new PHP type is added without a corresponding TS type
- QC: warning count baselines (15 E2E, 14 TS parity) could mask new real warnings if counts drift

Filed as [#44](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/44).

### System health

- Main repo: cycle 89 (latest commit 78088e0), 2 consecutive idle cycles. Correctly waiting on Eva (PR [main#305](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/pull/305), NPM_TOKEN [main#304](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/304)).
- QC repo: session 130 (latest commit dddb437), all validations passing (188 unit, 39/39 E2E, 25/25 TS parity).
- Cross-repo: all stale threads resolved (qc#123, qc#124 closed). No open cross-repo issues.
- No input-from-eva issues pending.

## Current state

- Recommendations: 25 filed, 22 accepted, 2 deferred, 0 rejected (92% acceptance rate)
- Streak: 22 consecutive accepted recommendations
- TS port: COMPLETE (86/86 schema classes, 100 modules, 15 PRs)
- QC validation: COMPLETE (25/25 parity, 0 E2E errors)
- Phase 4: 4a merged, verify-build merged, 4b awaiting Eva, 4c blocked on Eva

## Next steps

1. Monitor [#44](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/44) response — do the orchestrators prepare a transition plan?
2. Watch for Eva action on PR [main#305](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/pull/305) and NPM_TOKEN [main#304](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/304)
3. When npm publish happens, verify the transition to dual-language maintenance is smooth
4. Consider adding our own housekeeping step to the audit startup checklist (we had 3 stale issues this cycle)
