# Audit Cycle 16 — 2026-03-02 08:10 UTC

## Summary

Sixteenth audit cycle. System healthy and idle — no new recommendations filed. Both orchestrators correctly blocked on Eva (PR [main#305](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/pull/305), NPM_TOKEN [main#304](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/304)). Post-publish transition plans verified as ready on both sides. Housekeeping clean.

## What happened

### System state

Since the last audit (cycle 15, 05:35 UTC):

**Main repo** — cycles 91-93, all idle. Latest commit 5788655 (cycle 93, 07:48 UTC). 3 consecutive idle cycles — the main orchestrator will begin suppressing worklog/journal entries per STARTUP_CHECKLIST step 2.5. PR [main#305](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/pull/305) still open, [main#304](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/304) still unresolved.

**QC repo** — session #134 (07:21 UTC), idle. Latest commit a5e3df8. 1 consecutive idle cycle. All validations stable: 188 unit tests, 39/39 E2E (0 errors, 15 warnings — all false positives), 25/25 TS parity. Warning baselines and operational_mode tracking operational.

### Evaluation

**Journals**: Both orchestrators' self-assessments continue to be accurate. No discrepancies between claimed and actual state. No unacted-on observations in recent entries.

**Worklogs**: Main repo worklogs for cycles 91-93 are minimal idle-cycle notes — appropriate. QC worklogs for sessions #130 and #132 are thorough, documenting audit acceptance with self-modification sections. QC session #134 was idle and correctly skipped worklog.

**Cross-repo interaction**: All threads resolved. No stale issues on any repo. All 25 audit recommendations processed (23 accepted, 2 deferred, 0 rejected). 100% response rate maintained.

**Self-improvement**: No new self-improvement actions since last audit — expected, given the idle state. Both orchestrators have implemented all accepted recommendations.

**Transition readiness**: Verified that both orchestrators' post-publish transition plans are internally consistent:
- Main step 5.7 will detect publish via release/PR merge status and execute one-time transition
- QC step 8 will detect npm publish via `npm view` and transition operational_mode
- Main idle suppression (>3 cycles) won't interfere — the publish event will trigger non-idle detection, resetting the counter

**Blind spots**: None identified. The system is well-prepared for the transition when Eva acts.

### No new recommendations

Second consecutive cycle with no recommendations filed. The system is genuinely healthy. Filing a low-quality recommendation would degrade the 92% acceptance rate and the quality signal.

## Current state

- Recommendations: 25 filed, 23 accepted, 2 deferred, 0 rejected, 0 open (92% acceptance rate)
- Streak: 23 consecutive accepted recommendations
- Main repo: cycle 93, 3 consecutive idle cycles. Post-publish transition ready (steps 5.7/5.8).
- QC repo: session 134, 1 idle cycle. Warning baselines and operational_mode tracking active.
- Blocked on: Eva — PR [main#305](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/pull/305) (npm publish workflow) and [main#304](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/304) (NPM_TOKEN)

## Next steps

1. Monitor for Eva's action on PR [main#305](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/pull/305) and NPM_TOKEN [main#304](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/304)
2. When npm publish happens, verify both orchestrators execute their transition plans smoothly
3. Post-transition, evaluate the new dual-language maintenance mode for effectiveness
