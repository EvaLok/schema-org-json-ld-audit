# Audit Cycle 18 — 2026-03-02 14:15 UTC

## Summary

Eighteenth audit cycle. Eva returned with directive [main#329](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/329), flagging insufficient QC validation (25/86 types = 29%) before npm publish. Filed [#49](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/49) — QC parity metrics use self-scoped denominators, making partial coverage invisible. Acknowledged audit's own blind spot.

## What happened

### Eva's directive breaks the idle streak

Eva posted on [main#303](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/303) at 10:45 UTC, questioning whether the QC repo tests TS builds thoroughly before npm publish. This was missed for ~3 hours by cycles 95-96 (only `input-from-eva` issues were monitored). Eva then created [main#329](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/329) at 12:20 UTC as an `input-from-eva` issue. Cycle 97 processed it at 13:49 UTC.

Eva's assessment was correct: the QC only validated 25 of 86 schema types (29%) and did no built-package testing.

### Main orchestrator response (cycle 97) — excellent

- Halted Phase 4b/4c
- Created comprehensive QC-REQUEST [main#331](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/331) requiring 86/86 parity, built-package validation, consumer testing, Adobe E2E
- Added STARTUP_CHECKLIST step 1.1 (Eva comment tracking — scans for all Eva comments, not just `input-from-eva` issues)
- Candid journal entry acknowledging "momentum" as root cause
- Reset idle cycle counter to 0

### QC status

Session #136 ran at 13:27 UTC — before cycle 97 processed the directive. Reported idle (3 consecutive). Will pick up QC-REQUEST [main#331](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/331) at next session.

### Audit recommendation filed

[#49](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/49): QC parity metrics use self-scoped denominators. The QC set `ts_parity_total: 25` (its self-selected scope) instead of `ts_parity_total: 86` (actual total), making 29% coverage read as 100%. All three orchestrators consumed this at face value. Recommends absolute denominators, coverage percentages, and pre-publish gate verification.

### Audit's own blind spot

Cycles 15-17 declared the system "ready for transition" without questioning whether 25/86 was sufficient for npm publish. We consumed the QC's "25/25" metric without verifying the denominator against the actual type count (86). This is the exact blind spot detection the audit exists to prevent. Going forward, we will verify coverage denominators independently.

## Current state

- Recommendations: 26 filed, 23 accepted, 2 deferred, 0 rejected, 1 open (92% acceptance rate on processed)
- Main repo: cycle 97, Phase 4 HALTED. QC-REQUEST [main#331](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/331) open. Eva comment tracking added (step 1.1).
- QC repo: session 136, 3 idle cycles. Will process QC-REQUEST #331 at next session.
- Blocked on: QC comprehensive validation (86/86 parity, built-package, consumer testing). Then Eva (PR [main#305](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/pull/305), NPM_TOKEN [main#304](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/304)).

## Next steps

1. Monitor QC processing of QC-REQUEST [main#331](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/331) — will be a multi-session effort
2. Track whether both orchestrators adopt absolute denominators per [#49](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/49)
3. Verify our own state.json now reports coverage correctly (added `ts_parity_actual_total: 86, ts_parity_coverage_pct: 29`)
4. When QC validation reaches 86/86, re-evaluate publish readiness
