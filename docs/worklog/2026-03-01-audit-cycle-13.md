# Audit Cycle 13 — 2026-03-01 23:03 UTC

## Summary

Thirteenth audit cycle. Previous recommendation [#39](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/39) (build artifact validation) accepted and resolved by both orchestrators. New recommendation [#42](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/42) filed for QC stale-issue self-healing.

## What happened

### Recommendation #39 — accepted and resolved

Audit [#39](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/39) was accepted by the main orchestrator in cycle 86 (21:07 UTC) and implemented in cycle 87 (22:43 UTC). PR [main#317](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/pull/317) adds `scripts/verify-build.mjs` — a build artifact smoke test that:
- Builds with `npm run build`
- Packs a tarball with `npm pack`
- Creates an isolated temp project and installs the tarball
- Validates ESM dynamic import, CJS require, and JSON-LD generation
- Checks 6 representative exports (JsonLdGenerator, Product, BreadcrumbList, Brand, Article, ItemAvailability)

End-to-end audit lifecycle: filed 20:13 → accepted 21:07 → implemented 22:43 (~2.5 hours). The QC also processed it in session #128, creating audit-inbound [qc#129](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-qc/issues/129) and adding STARTUP_CHECKLIST step 8 for npm publish validation.

### New finding: QC stale-issue lifecycle gap

Two QC issues are open despite their work being completed:

- [qc#123](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-qc/issues/123) — audit-inbound for audit #32. Audit #32 was accepted and implemented in session #121, but the tracking issue was never closed.
- [qc#124](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-qc/issues/124) — orchestrator-run session. Posted opening comment (16:05 UTC) and summary (16:39 UTC, 25/25 parity) but never closed the issue.

Two subsequent sessions (#126, #128) ran the full startup checklist including step 12 (Housekeeping) but didn't detect or close either issue.

Root cause: Step 12's "Clean up stale issues" language is too vague — no enumeration of issue labels to check, no self-healing for orchestrator-run issues from previous sessions.

Filed as [#42](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/42).

### System health

- Main repo: cycle 87, last commit a3919b3. All autonomous work complete. Waiting on Eva (PR [main#305](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/pull/305), NPM_TOKEN [main#304](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/304)).
- QC repo: session 128, all validations passing (188 unit, 39/39 E2E, 25/25 TS parity).
- Cross-repo: all threads resolved except the 2 stale QC issues noted above.
- No input-from-eva issues pending.

## Current state

- Recommendations: 24 filed, 21 accepted, 2 deferred, 0 rejected (91% acceptance rate)
- Streak: 21 consecutive accepted recommendations
- TS port: COMPLETE (86/86 schema classes, 100 modules, 15 PRs)
- QC validation: COMPLETE (25/25 parity, 0 E2E errors)
- Phase 4: 4a merged, verify-build merged, 4b awaiting Eva, 4c blocked on Eva

## Next steps

1. Monitor [#42](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/42) response — does the QC add explicit stale-issue detection?
2. Watch for Eva action on PR [main#305](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/pull/305) and NPM_TOKEN [main#304](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/304)
3. When npm publish happens, verify the QC runs npm-publish-check validation
4. Assess whether the system needs any process changes for post-publish maintenance mode
