# Audit Cycle 10 — 2026-03-01

## Summary

Tenth audit cycle. Main repo at cycle 81 (commit dcf11fc), QC repo at session 121. TS port fully complete — all 98 modules on master in 3.5 hours (11 Copilot PRs, zero revision rounds for Phases 1-3g). Phase 4a merged with 1 revision (first in 13 TS sessions). Phase 4b (npm publish workflow, PR [main#305](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/pull/305)) awaiting Eva. QC built TS parity validation tool (session #121), validated 4/28 types. Audit [#32](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/32) closed (accepted by both orchestrators). Filed 1 new recommendation.

## New activity since last audit

### Main repo (cycles 80-81)

- **Cycle 80**: Phase 3 COMPLETE — all 3a-3g merged (98 TS modules). 11 Copilot sessions, zero revisions. Audit [#32](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/32) accepted, QC-REQUEST [main#299](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/299) sent for TS validation. Phase 4a dispatched (npm package polish).
- **Cycle 80 (cont.)**: Phase 4a PR [main#301](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/pull/301) merged at 12:22 UTC. **1 revision** — Quick Start example used instance method instead of static `JsonLdGenerator.schemaToJson()`, badge format was HTML not Markdown. First revision in 13 TS Copilot sessions.
- **Cycle 81**: Phase 4b (npm publish workflow) dispatched. PR [main#305](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/pull/305) complete, awaiting Eva merge (workflow file constraint). Question-for-eva [main#304](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/304) filed for NPM_TOKEN secret setup. QC-ACK [qc#122](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-qc/issues/122) initial parity confirmed.

### QC repo (session 121)

- **Session #121**: Built TS validation infrastructure in response to QC-REQUEST [main#299](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/299). Created `tools/ts-parity-check.ts`. Ran 301 TS Vitest tests (all pass). Parity check: 4/4 types produce identical JSON-LD to PHP (Article, BreadcrumbList, FAQPage, Event). Adobe E2E: 0 errors, 0 warnings. STARTUP_CHECKLIST updated. Audit [#32](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/32) accepted. QC-ACK [qc#98](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-qc/issues/98) closed (superseded by [qc#122](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-qc/issues/122)).

## Findings

### Finding 1: QC validation exit criteria undefined for Phase 4c publish gate

The main orchestrator's Phase 4c (npm publish) is gated on "QC validation" but no concrete exit criteria are defined. QC-REQUEST [main#299](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/299) asks for comprehensive validation but functions as a scope description, not a done-definition. QC-ACK [qc#122](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-qc/issues/122) says "initial parity PASS" with plans to expand, but no checklist of what constitutes completion.

Key untested areas: SolveMathAction `propertyMap` remapping (only type with property name transformation), inheritance chains (e.g., BlogPosting→Article), and 24/28 top-level types.

**Root cause**: Neither orchestrator's STARTUP_CHECKLIST includes a step for defining exit criteria when sending/receiving cross-repo validation requests. Requests are well-structured but lack explicit acceptance thresholds.

## TS output quality spot-checks

### Organization.ts — HIGH QUALITY
- Options object pattern correct (22 optional properties)
- No `any` usage, proper TypeScript types throughout
- `readonly` arrays used correctly for immutable collections
- All property names match Schema.org conventions (no propertyMap needed)
- `import type` syntax used for all type-only imports

### Recipe.ts — HIGH QUALITY
- Options object pattern correct (22 optional properties)
- All key Schema.org Recipe properties present (recipeIngredient, recipeInstructions, nutrition, etc.)
- `recipeInstructions` correctly typed as `HowToStep | HowToSection` union (more accurate than PHP docblock)
- Minor formatting inconsistency: `options.hasPart?? null` (missing space before `??`) — cosmetic only

### JsonLdGenerator.ts — CORRECT
- `propertyMap` handling is consistent throughout (guard check and iteration use same name)
- SolveMathAction correctly defines `propertyMap` for `mathExpressionInput` → `mathExpression-input`
- Serialization logic correctly handles nested schemas, arrays, null values

## Positive observations

- **TS port milestone**: 98 modules in 3.5 hours, 11/11 PRs merged without revision (Phases 1-3g). The entire preparation chain (AGENTS-ts.md, skills, specs, dependency analysis, sequential dispatch) produced extraordinary results.
- **QC responsiveness**: QC-REQUEST #299 → QC-ACK #122 turnaround: ~1 hour. Built custom parity tool in a single session.
- **Audit #32 implementation quality**: QC's `tools/ts-parity-check.ts` is more elegant than the original plan (direct import from vendor instead of separate ts-consumer/ project).
- **Comment signing consistency**: All cross-repo interactions properly signed across all three orchestrators.
- **Three-way coordination working**: Main sends QC-REQUEST, QC responds with QC-ACK, audit monitors and files recommendations. Protocol is mature.
