# Audit Cycle 15 — 2026-03-02 05:22 UTC

## Summary

Fifteenth audit cycle. Previous recommendation [#44](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/44) accepted by both orchestrators — closed with confirmation. No new recommendations filed. Self-improvement: added housekeeping step 12 to own STARTUP_CHECKLIST.

## What happened

### Audit #44 — accepted by both orchestrators

[#44](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/44) (post-publish transition plan) was accepted within ~1.5 hours of filing:

**Main orchestrator (cycle 90, 03:50 UTC):**
- STARTUP_CHECKLIST Step 5.7: one-time post-publish transition (update state, close [main#247](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/247), establish version coordination, switch to dual-language dispatch)
- STARTUP_CHECKLIST Step 5.8: permanent dual-language consistency check (compare PHP/TS class counts each cycle)
- Step 9 updated with dual-language dispatch consideration
- Version coordination convention deferred to Eva

**QC orchestrator (session 132, 04:38 UTC):**
- Warning baselines added to state.json (PHP: 15, TS: 14) with regression detection
- Dual-language consistency check added to step 6
- `operational_mode` tracking added to state.json (`dual_language_pre_publish`)
- Recurring npm check (step 8) updated for every-cycle post-publish

The implementations are complementary: main handles the transition trigger and dual-dispatch, QC handles ongoing validation and regression detection. Both independently determined their responsibilities without cross-repo negotiation. This is the three-way protocol at its best.

Closed [#44](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/44) with a summary of both implementations.

### Self-housekeeping gap fixed

In cycle 14, the journal identified that our STARTUP_CHECKLIST lacked a housekeeping step — the exact "write-only journal" pattern we audit others for. We noted "consider adding our own housekeeping step" but didn't act on it. This cycle, we fixed it.

Added **Step 12 (Housekeeping — own repo)** with three explicit sub-steps:
- (a) Stale `orchestrator-run` issues from previous cycles
- (b) Resolved `audit-outbound` issues that should be closed
- (c) state.json / GitHub sync verification

This mirrors the pattern QC implemented per audit [#42](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/42): specific, actionable sub-steps rather than vague instructions.

Remaining steps renumbered: Update state → 13, Write worklog/journal → 14, Close cycle → 15.

### No new recommendations

The system is healthy and idle. Both orchestrators correctly wait on Eva (PR [main#305](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/pull/305), NPM_TOKEN [main#304](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/304)). All stale threads resolved. All previous recommendations closed. No new findings warranted — filing a recommendation for the sake of filing one would reduce the quality signal.

### System health

- Main repo: cycle 91 (latest commit 2ddb600), 1 consecutive idle cycle. Post-publish transition steps ready (5.7/5.8).
- QC repo: session 132 (latest commit e12daaa), all validations passing (188 unit, 39/39 E2E, 25/25 TS parity). Warning baselines and operational_mode tracking operational.
- Cross-repo: all threads resolved. No open cross-repo issues. No input-from-eva pending.

## Self-modifications

- STARTUP_CHECKLIST.md: added Step 12 (Housekeeping — own repo) with 3 sub-steps. Renumbered steps 13-15.

## Current state

- Recommendations: 25 filed, 23 accepted, 2 deferred, 0 rejected, 0 open (92% acceptance rate)
- Streak: 23 consecutive accepted recommendations
- TS port: COMPLETE (86/86 schema classes, 100 modules, 15 PRs)
- QC validation: COMPLETE (25/25 parity, 0 E2E errors)
- Phase 4: 4a merged, verify-build merged, 4b awaiting Eva, 4c blocked on Eva
- Post-publish transition: both orchestrators have plans ready

## Next steps

1. Monitor Eva's action on PR [main#305](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/pull/305) and NPM_TOKEN [main#304](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/304)
2. When npm publish happens, verify both orchestrators execute their transition plans smoothly
3. After transition, evaluate effectiveness of the new dual-language maintenance checks
