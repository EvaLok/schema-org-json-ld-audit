# Audit Cycle 17 — 2026-03-02 11:13 UTC

## Summary

Seventeenth audit cycle. System healthy and idle — no new recommendations filed (third consecutive clean cycle). Both orchestrators correctly blocked on Eva (PR [main#305](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/pull/305), NPM_TOKEN [main#304](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/304)). Housekeeping clean.

## What happened

### System state

Since the last audit (cycle 16, 08:10 UTC):

**Main repo** — cycles 94-95, both idle. Latest commit 2daf4ea (cycle 95, 10:47 UTC). 5 consecutive idle cycles — worklog/journal suppression active since cycle 94 (>3 threshold). Only state.json heartbeat commits being produced. PR [main#305](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/pull/305) still open, [main#304](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/304) still unresolved.

**QC repo** — session #135 (10:19 UTC), idle. Latest commit 6024990. 2 consecutive idle cycles. All validations stable: 188 unit tests, 39/39 E2E (0 errors, 15 warnings — all false positives), 25/25 TS parity. Warning baselines and operational_mode tracking operational.

### Evaluation

**Journals**: Main repo journal stopped at cycle 90 — correct behavior per idle suppression. QC journal from session #132 is the latest substantive entry. Both repos' self-assessments continue to be accurate.

**Worklogs**: Main repo worklogs stopped at cycle 93 — correct behavior. QC last substantive worklog was session #132. Sessions #134 and #135 were idle.

**Cross-repo interaction**: All threads resolved. No stale issues on any repo. All 25 audit recommendations processed. 100% response rate maintained.

**Self-improvement**: Main repo idle suppression working as designed — only state.json heartbeat commits since cycle 94. No new self-improvement actions needed in idle state.

**Blind spots**: None identified. Verified PR #305 has no merge conflict risk (repo is idle, no competing changes to .github/workflows). Transition readiness unchanged from cycle 16.

### No new recommendations

Third consecutive cycle with no recommendations filed. The system is genuinely healthy and waiting on a single human (Eva) to take two actions. Filing a low-quality recommendation would degrade the 92% acceptance rate and provide no value.

## Current state

- Recommendations: 25 filed, 23 accepted, 2 deferred, 0 rejected, 0 open (92% acceptance rate)
- Streak: 23 consecutive accepted recommendations
- Main repo: cycle 95, 5 consecutive idle cycles. Worklog/journal suppressed. Post-publish transition ready.
- QC repo: session 135, 2 idle cycles. Warning baselines and operational_mode tracking active.
- Blocked on: Eva — PR [main#305](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/pull/305) (npm publish workflow) and [main#304](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/304) (NPM_TOKEN)

## Next steps

1. Monitor for Eva's action on PR [main#305](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/pull/305) and NPM_TOKEN [main#304](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/304)
2. When npm publish happens, verify both orchestrators execute their transition plans smoothly
3. Post-transition, evaluate the new dual-language maintenance mode for effectiveness
