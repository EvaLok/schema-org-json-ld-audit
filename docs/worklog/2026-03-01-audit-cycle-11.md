# Audit Cycle 11 — 2026-03-01

## Summary

Eleventh audit cycle. Main repo at cycle 83 (commit f70f36d), QC repo at session 124. QC TypeScript validation COMPLETE — 23/23 parity match, 0 E2E errors, all 5 audit [#35](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/35) DoD criteria satisfied. Both QC-ACK [qc#122](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-qc/issues/122) and QC-REQUEST [main#299](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/299) closed. Found 2 PHP schema classes (QAPage, Restaurant) missing from TS via directory comparison — the "98 modules" count matched coincidentally. Filed 1 new recommendation.

## New activity since last audit

### Main repo (cycles 82-83)

- **Cycle 82**: Audit [#35](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/35) accepted. Posted Definition of Done with 5 checkable criteria on QC-REQUEST [main#299](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/299). Updated STARTUP_CHECKLIST Step 4 to require DoD sections in all QC-REQUESTs. Created audit-inbound [main#307](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/307) — immediately closed.
- **Cycle 83**: QC validation COMPLETE. Closed QC-REQUEST [main#299](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/299) after verifying all 5 DoD criteria satisfied. Phase 4c QC gate cleared. Only Eva blockers remain (PR [main#305](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/pull/305) merge + NPM_TOKEN [main#304](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld/issues/304)).

### QC repo (session 124)

- **Session #124**: Expanded TS parity from 4 types to **23 types** — all match. 0 E2E errors, 14 warnings (all known false positives). Validated SolveMathAction propertyMap remapping, 6 inheritance chains (BlogPosting, NewsArticle, MobileApp, WebApp, FoodEstablishment, Store). Noted QAPage and Restaurant have PHP generate scripts but no TS classes. Closed QC-ACK [qc#122](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-qc/issues/122) with comprehensive DoD satisfaction.

## Findings

### Finding 1: 2 PHP schema classes missing from TypeScript — coincidental count match

**Observed**: `php/src/v1/Schema/` contains 86 files. `ts/src/schema/` contains 84 files. The missing types are **QAPage** (a top-level schema type, PHP PR #61) and **Restaurant** (a sub-type of LocalBusiness/FoodEstablishment). The "98 modules" count matches between PHP (86 schema + 12 enums = 98) and TS (84 schema + 12 enums + 2 core = 98) purely by coincidence — the identical totals masked the composition difference.

The QC caught this in session #124 ("QAPage and Restaurant have PHP generate scripts but no corresponding TS classes yet"), but the main orchestrator's cycle 83 closed QC-REQUEST #299 focusing only on the 5 DoD checkboxes — all satisfied — without addressing the QC's gap observation.

**Root cause**: (1) Phase 3 dependency decomposition started from an independently generated list, never cross-referenced against the PHP class directory. (2) The "98 = 98" count match created false confidence. (3) DoD criteria (audit #35) were scoped to E2E parity, not class inventory. (4) Main orchestrator checked DoD criteria but didn't read supplementary QC observations.

Filed as [#37](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/37).

### Housekeeping: Stale cycle issues closed

Closed [#27](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/27), [#30](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/30), [#33](https://github.com/EvaLok/schema-org-json-ld-audit/issues/33) — stale orchestrator-run issues from cycles 7-9 that were never properly closed. Self-improvement note: the audit's own issue lifecycle management needs the same discipline recommended to other orchestrators.

## Positive observations

- **DoD pattern working**: The audit #35 exit criteria were accepted and implemented in a single cycle. The QC structured its closing report as checkbox-by-checkbox verification against the criteria. This pattern generalizes well for all cross-repo validation requests.
- **QC validation speed**: QC expanded parity from 4 to 23 types in a single session. The `tools/ts-parity-check.ts` tool proved effective and extensible.
- **Cross-repo round-trip**: QC-REQUEST #299 posted 12:12Z → DoD added 15:06Z → QC validated 16:37Z → Request closed 16:43Z. Full lifecycle in ~4.5 hours.
- **System approaching publication**: All automated gates cleared. Only human actions remain (Eva merging PR #305, configuring NPM_TOKEN).
- **19 consecutive accepted recommendations** — acceptance rate 91%.
