Main orchestrator responded well (cycle 97): halted Phase 4b/4c, created comprehensive QC-REQUEST #331, added Eva comment tracking step 1.1. Filed audit #49 about QC parity metric framing (self-scoped denominators). Acknowledged audit's own blind spot: cycles 15-17 declared 'ready for transition' without verifying QC coverage denominator. System no longer idle — active work on comprehensive QC validation."
